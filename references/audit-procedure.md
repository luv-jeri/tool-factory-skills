## Part A — Pipeline stages 0–8

---

### Stage 0 — Intake

**Purpose:** Establish the target before touching any competitor data.

**Actions:**
1. Ingest the product gist or PRD; extract the primary job-to-be-done (JTBD) in one sentence.
2. Derive the keyword cluster: head term + top variant phrasings.
3. Collect seed competitors (from user input, from `pick-next-tool` output, or both).
4. If `builds/<tool-slug>/research-raw.json` exists from a prior `pick-next-tool` run, ingest it — reuse any `volume_buckets` and `autocomplete_fanout` data rather than re-fetching.

**Data:** product gist / PRD, `research-raw.json` (optional), user-provided seeds.

**PASS:** JTBD is one clear sentence; head term is identified; keyword cluster has ≥3 phrasings.

**Out:** `{ jtbd, head_term, cluster_phrasings[], seed_competitors[], reused_pick_next_tool_data }`.

---

### Stage 1 — Discover

**Purpose:** Build a ground-truth competitor list from the live SERP — not from memory.

**Actions:**
1. Capture the live page-1 SERP for the head term (chrome-devtools → Google; screenshot + DOM).
2. Capture SERP for top 2–3 cluster variant phrasings.
3. Harvest all organic URLs from positions 1–10 per SERP. Extract root domain.
4. Merge harvested domains with seed competitors; deduplicate.
5. Classify each: `direct_tool` / `aggregator` / `saas_paywall` / `content_blog` / `off_topic`.

**Data:** Live SERP screenshots + DOM, harvested URL list.

**PASS (Gate A):** ≥3 `direct_tool` competitors found. If fewer, **REFUSE** — do not continue with a fabricated landscape.

**Out:** Classified, deduplicated competitor list with SERP position (or `null` if from seed only).

---

### Stage 2 — Triage

**Purpose:** Select the K ≈ 8–10 competitors that matter most for this cluster.

**Actions:**
1. Rank candidates by actual SERP position across the cluster (lower rank = higher priority).
2. Promote any seed competitor not found in SERP if it is a known direct competitor.
3. Drop off-topic / aggregator entries with a one-line reason.
4. Confirm final list of K competitors with the user (or proceed if running autonomously).

**Data:** Classified list from Stage 1.

**PASS:** Final list of K ≤ 10 direct competitors confirmed; each dropped candidate has a stated reason.

**Out:** `triaged_competitors[]` — the exact set the fan-out will audit.

---

### Stage 3 — Empirical audit fan-out

**Purpose:** Collect all 10-pillar measured fields for every competitor via live browser-driven audits.

**Actions:**
1. Execute `scripts/audit-workflow.js` with the triaged competitor list, keyword cluster, and pillar field schema as args.
2. Per competitor the workflow runs: Researcher agent (collects all 10-pillar fields) + Adversarial skeptic agent (re-verifies the 3 most decision-critical claims).
3. Receive schema-validated JSON per competitor with an evidence tier per field.
4. Any field that cannot be measured returns `UNVERIFIED` — never silently 0.

**Data:** Live SERP, Lighthouse audits, screenshots, `parse_jsonld.py` output, OpenPageRank, Similarweb.

**PASS (Gate B):** For each competitor, all REQUIRED_FIELDS from `competitor_strength.py` are present and typed correctly (or explicitly `UNVERIFIED` with a reason). Zero silently-zero fields.

**Out:** `per_competitor_measured_json[]`, each field tagged with evidence tier.

---

### Stage 4 — Score

**Purpose:** Produce deterministic, reproducible competitor strength scores and gap opportunity scores.

**Actions:**
1. For each competitor: `python3 scripts/competitor_strength.py --json <competitor.json>`
2. For each detected gap: `python3 scripts/gap_opportunity.py --json <gaps.json>`
3. No manual score adjustments. Numbers come from the scripts only.

**Data:** Per-competitor measured JSON from Stage 3.

**PASS:** All competitors have a `strength` score; all gaps have an `opportunity` score and tier. No `ContractError` left unresolved.

**Out:** `scored_competitors[]`, `scored_gaps[]`.

---

### Stage 5 — Gap synthesis

**Purpose:** Build the master feature matrix and articulate the wedge.

**Actions:**
1. Construct the master feature matrix: competitors × features, using Stage 3 measured data.
2. Consolidate gaps by category: UX/SEO/perf/a11y/monetization.
3. Rank gaps by `opportunity` score (descending, from scripts).
4. Draft the wedge/positioning (≤3 sentences) based on the highest-scoring build-now gaps.
5. **Check Gate C:** if the cluster SERP is dominated by an AI Overview that fully answers the JTBD → raise existential-risk flag before claiming any opportunity.

**Data:** Scored competitors, scored gaps, master feature matrix.

**PASS:** Gap table is ranked by script output; existential-risk flag evaluated; wedge is one clear statement.

**Out:** Ranked gap table, master feature matrix, wedge draft.

---

### Stage 6 — Adversarial kill pass

**Purpose:** Eliminate false opportunities before they enter the brief.

**Actions:**
1. A separate skeptic agent challenges each build-now gap: "Does the measured data actually confirm competitors fail this, or was it assumed?"
2. Challenge the AI-Overview risk: "Is the AI Overview citing a competitor? What exactly does it answer?"
3. For any gap backed by reasoned-tier evidence: demote to `hypothesis`.
4. Re-run `gap_opportunity.py` on any gap with corrected inputs.

**Data:** Ranked gap table + all evidence ledger entries.

**PASS:** Every build-now gap is backed by real-measured or triangulated evidence. No committed exploit rests on reasoned-tier or UNVERIFIED evidence.

**Out:** Final validated gap table; any demoted gaps moved to `open_questions` in the PRD-SEED.

---

### Stage 7 — Write deliverables

**Purpose:** Produce the human-readable brief and machine-readable ledger.

**Actions:**
1. Write `builds/<tool-slug>/COMPETITIVE-BRIEF.md` (see `references/deliverables.md` for template).
2. Write `builds/<tool-slug>/research-raw.json` (source ledger — every claim with `url + date_accessed + method + evidence_tier`).
3. Optionally regenerate `report.html` (tabbed dashboard).

**Data:** All prior stage outputs.

**PASS:** Brief has all 9 required sections; every claim in the brief traces to an entry in `research-raw.json`; no UNVERIFIED claim appears as a committed exploit.

**Out:** `COMPETITIVE-BRIEF.md`, `research-raw.json`, optional `report.html`.

---

### Stage 8 — Handoff

**Purpose:** Emit the machine-readable PRD-SEED block for downstream consumption.

**Actions:**
1. Populate the `prd_seed:` YAML block (full schema in `references/deliverables.md`).
2. Append it as a fenced YAML block at the end of `COMPETITIVE-BRIEF.md`.
3. Verify all required fields are present and non-empty.

**Data:** Validated gap table, wedge, PRD-SEED fields.

**PASS:** `prd_seed:` block is valid YAML; `performance_budget` values are set to beat the best-measured competitor; `ai_overview_risk` is populated.

**Out:** Final `COMPETITIVE-BRIEF.md` with appended `prd_seed:` block.

---

## Part B — Per-competitor browser-driven recipe

Executed by the Researcher agent inside `scripts/audit-workflow.js` for each competitor in the triaged list.
Steps are in dependency order — do not reorder.

---

### Step 1 — Capture live SERP + AI Overview

**Pillar fields filled:** `serp_rank`, `ai_overview_cited`, `serp_features_owned`, PAA questions list.

1. Open `https://www.google.com/search?q=<head+term>` in a fresh browser context (chrome-devtools `navigate_page`).
2. Take a full-page screenshot (`take_screenshot`).
3. Scrape DOM for organic results: position each `<a>` in `.MjjYud` (or equivalent Google result container).
4. Record competitor's position as `serp_rank` (integer 1–10, or `null`).
5. Check for AI Overview box (`#aiOverview` or `#ai-overview` selector): if present, record `ai_overview_cited=True/False` based on whether the competitor URL appears in the sources.
6. Count SERP features owned by the competitor: featured snippet, PAA mention, calculator/widget onebox, image/video pack, site-links.
7. Harvest all PAA questions shown — used for `paa_coverage` calculation in Step 4.

---

### Step 2 — Lighthouse audit (CWV + a11y)

**Pillar fields filled:** `lcp_ms`, `cls`, `inp_ms`, `a11y_score` (Pillars 7 + 8).

1. Navigate to the competitor's tool page (not homepage unless the tool IS the homepage).
2. Run `lighthouse_audit` (chrome-devtools) — mobile preset first, then desktop.
   - Mobile: record `lcp_ms`, `cls`, `inp_ms` (or TBT proxy), `a11y_score`, perf score, page weight, request count.
   - Desktop: record same set (for the brief; script uses mobile values for conservatism).
3. Attach the raw lighthouse JSON to the ledger entry as `method: "lighthouse_audit"`.
4. **IRON LAW:** Do not assert any CWV or a11y claim without this step's output. "Seems fast" is not a measurement.

---

### Step 3 — Desktop + mobile screenshots

**Pillar fields filled:** UI/UX quality notes (Pillar 6), mobile render quality (Pillar 10).

1. Desktop screenshot: `take_screenshot` at standard 1280×800 viewport.
2. Mobile screenshot: `resize_window` or `emulate` to 375×812 (iPhone 14 viewport), then `take_screenshot`.
3. Save both screenshots with filenames `<competitor-slug>-desktop.png` / `<competitor-slug>-mobile.png` to `builds/<tool-slug>/screenshots/`.
4. Note visible trust signals (about/author/method/contact/HTTPS/review badge).

---

### Step 4 — Use the tool live

**Pillar fields filled:** `clicks_to_result`, `feature_coverage`, gated-features list (Pillar 5 + 6).

1. Open the competitor tool page fresh (not from SERP page).
2. Count clicks from landing to seeing a result — record as `clicks_to_result` (minimum 1).
3. Work through the canonical feature checklist for the tool type (see `references/pillars.md` Pillar 5).
4. Record which features are present, absent, or gated (email capture / paywall).
5. Calculate `feature_coverage = present_features / total_checklist_items`.
6. Note any ad units visible above the fold; estimate ad density.

---

### Step 5 — Parse structured data

**Pillar fields filled:** `schema_types` (Pillar 4b).

```bash
python3 scripts/parse_jsonld.py --url <competitor-url>
```

1. Run `parse_jsonld.py` — it fetches the page, extracts all JSON-LD `<script>` blocks, collects `@type` values, validates against schema.org.
2. Record the output list as `schema_types`. Empty list `[]` is a valid real-measured result.
3. Do NOT infer schema presence from page structure or meta tags — `parse_jsonld.py` output only.
4. Attach the raw output to the ledger entry as `method: "parse_jsonld"`.

---

### Step 6 — Authority + traffic data

**Pillar fields filled:** `dr`, `referring_domains` (Pillar 2), traffic estimate (Pillar 3).

1. OpenPageRank API (free key): `GET https://openpagerank.com/api/v1.0/getPageRank?domains[0]=<domain>`
   - Record `domainRank` as `dr` (triangulated; note OPR understates Ahrefs DR).
   - Record `externalBacklinks` as `referring_domains` proxy.
2. Optionally cross-check with Ahrefs Website Authority Checker (manual, free, no key required).
   If both sources agree within ±10 DR points → `evidence_tier: "triangulated"`. If they disagree >10 → flag, use lower value, note discrepancy.
3. Similarweb free: navigate to `https://www.similarweb.com/website/<domain>/` → record estimated monthly visits and top-keyword count.
4. Record all values with `url`, `date_accessed`, `method`, `evidence_tier` in `research-raw.json`.
